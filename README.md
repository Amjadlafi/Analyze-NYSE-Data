# Introduction
 In this project I did analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. I did drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&amp;P 500 companies. Through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. I did perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.
